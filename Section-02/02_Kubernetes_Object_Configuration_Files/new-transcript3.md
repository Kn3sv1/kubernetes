# generate yaml using imperitive commands

It's definitely worth memorising some of these commands,

But here's a quick way to help jog your memory if you're struggling to remember them:

```bash
$ kubectl run --help | grep 'kubectl run'
$ kubectl run --help | grep 'restart'
```
You can tweak these commands and add the dry-run and yaml output settings to generate your yaml files.
