Chrome -> vscode

This course comes with is very own study guide. You can find it on Github, that means that you can download this  guide by just doing a git clone. 

This guide is made up of a number of sections and each section contains a series of topic folders. This section and topic structure, mirrors the Udemy course itself. So for each video in this course there is a corresponding topic folder. 

For example, right now you're watching the video for this topic, the Kubernetes study guide. 

Each topic folder contains a readme file. These README files cover everything the videos cover, but in more detail, and they contain a lot of useful links and example commands. I recommend that you review the readme files as you go through the course.

In a lot of the videos, we'll make use of various yaml files. You can find these files in the corresponding topic folder, under a folder called configs. So if you want to follow along and copy what I do in a particular demo, then the very first thing you have to do, is open up a bash terminal and then cd to that video's topic folder. This will make it easier to work with these config files from the command line. 

If you are using VS code, then there's a handy shortcut to quickly let you do this. All you have to do is use the explorer side bar to navigate to the video's topic folder and then open up a bash terminal inside it.

During the demo's, I'll usually have the side bar minimised by toggling the explorer icon so that there's more screen space for the actual demo itself.
