Hello Everyone, my name is Sher Chowdhury and welcome to my course, Kubernetes by example

I am based in the UK and I've been working in IT for about 15 years, both for the Government, and in the private sector. 

In 2019 I passed the Kubernetes exam and became a certified kubernetes administrator. 

I have designed this course to make it really easy for you to follow-along with all the demos. So if you copy all the steps I take, then not only will you learn Kubernetes faster, but you will also:

- Setup your very own Kubernetes Environment using Minikube
- Run containers by creating pods
- Get pods talking to each other by creating services
- Create a group of identical pods using Replicasets and Deployments
- Create Ingress rules to make your pods accessible to the outside world
- Store your pod's data using Persistent Volumes and Persistant Volume Claims.
- ...AND Create all of these objects by first writng yaml files and then feeding these files to kubernetes
  
We'll cover all of this in just the first couple of hours of the course!

And as you progress through the rest of the course, you will get hands-on experience with the more advanced features of Kubernetes.

The ideal person for this course is a Linux user who has some basic Docker experience. In case you want to  become a Certified Kuberenetes Administrator, then this course is a great starting point as well. That's because we'll be hands-on, just like the exam itself. We'll also provide you with lots of exam tips and best practice guidance along the way. 

So feel free to take a look at the course description, and I look forward to seeing you inside.
